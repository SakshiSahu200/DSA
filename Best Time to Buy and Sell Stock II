to find max profit on every purchase....buy first then immediately have to sell it before buying another
Input: prices = [7,1,5,3,6,4]
Output: 7
 Logic: find the local maxima and minima....on local minima, we will purchase and sell it on local maxima
 further optimizing...buy it then sell it if it is greater than price on next day.
